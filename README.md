# Python-tkinter-bank-app
1st - The following steps are involved:
  - Develop a Banking Application capable of making Deposits and Withdrawals in the program, track these transactions, and update the bank statement.
  - This project utilizes Python to read, write, and add to existing files to produce an interactable file.
  - Use Exceptions to avoid errors that could be caused by user input, such as ValueErrors produced from a user trying to add letters into a bank account instead of numbers.
  - Variables should be kept localized to avoid complications and make actions explicit. Combine sourced information legally & cohesively.

Minimum Project Requirements:
  - A Bank application with 2 txt files:
    - BankData.txt to keep all your bank information e.g., money you have in your account.
    - TransactionLog.txt to keep your transactions e.g., your withdrawals and deposits.
  - Your bank application should ask the following questions when the user interacts with it:
    - "Would you like to make a transaction?" (Yes or No)
    - "Would you like to make a deposit or withdrawal?" (Yes or No)
    - Display the current balance every time at this stage.
    - "How much would you like to deposit?" or "How much would you like to withdraw?"
  - After all deposits or withdrawals, the user must be able to see the current balance.
  - When the user enters incorrect information, the application should display "You provided an invalid input."
